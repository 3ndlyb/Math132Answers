## How to Use

1. **Navigate to a Sheet Folder:**
   Each sheet has its own folder (e.g., `Sheet0`, `Sheet1`, etc.). Inside each folder, you will find:
   - A PDF file containing the problem sheet (`Math - 132 - sheetX.pdf`).
   - A LaTeX file containing the answers (`main.tex`).
   - A compiled PDF of the answers (`SheetXAns.pdf`).

2. **View or Edit Answers:**
   - To view the answers, open the `SheetXAns.pdf` file.
   - To edit the answers, modify the `main.tex` file and recompile it to generate a new PDF.

3. **Compiling LaTeX Files:**
   If you want to compile the LaTeX files yourself, ensure you have a LaTeX distribution installed (e.g., TeX Live, MiKTeX). Use the following command:
   ```bash
   pdflatex main.tex
   ```
